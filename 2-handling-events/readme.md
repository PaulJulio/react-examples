# Handling Events

React makes it easy to handle many types of events within components. Just pass a prop to the component with a callback function and you're off to the races.

You can see a [full list of React events here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html)

## Serve the example

To run this example you'll need to serve this directory with a web server, for example, with the `http-server` npm module:

```bash
npm i -g http-server
http-server .
```

Or, if you system has Python built in, this:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Then, open up <http://localhost:8080> in your browser.
