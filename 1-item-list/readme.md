# Item List

Simple example of showing a list of items using a parent component, `<List>` and child components rendered via a `<Item>` component.

This example uses React's [functional stateless components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html) as well as a standard class component.

## Serve the example

To run this example you'll need to serve this directory with a web server, for example, with the `http-server` npm module:

```bash
npm i -g http-server
http-server .
```

Or, if you system has Python built in, this:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Then, open up <http://localhost:8080> in your browser.
